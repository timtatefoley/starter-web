FORCE Ipsum Episode 5

Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.

Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend! Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. Yeah, you're a real hero.

Princess...we have a visitor. We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east. It's metal. Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke. It could be a speeder, one of ours. No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through.

They're my friends. I've got to help them. You must not go! But Han and Leia will die if I don't. You don't know that.

There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me. Who's worried? Oh. No one to meet us.
