FORCE Ipsum Episode 1

Captain. Yes, sir? Tell them we wish to board at once. With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately. Yes, yes, of course, as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador. I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.

I don't think so, No one can kill a Jedi. I wish that were so. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here to free all the slaves, have you come to free us? No, I'm afraid not.

You wanna see? Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter. Come on! I'll show you Threepio! Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet. He's wonderful! You really like him? He's a protocol droid, to help Mom. Watch! Oh, oh.

I take Anakin as my Padawan learner. An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second. The code forbids it.

We're hit Artoo! Wah. I'm tring to stop. I'm tring to stop. Everything's overheated. Oops! This is not good. Noooo! No given up General Ja Ja.
