FORCE Ipsum - Episode 7

This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. Well, because of you now we have a chance.

Han told me. Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back.

We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have been helped in the escape-- Anything else? The two were accompanied by a girl. What girl? It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! How bad is it?! If we wanna live, not good! They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is 'need to know' -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know! This? You gotta tell us where the base is. I don't speak that. Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? Droid, please. Pilex driver, hurry! So where's your base? Go on BB-8, tell her. Please! The Ileenium system? Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs! Close the blast doors from here? Resetting the fuses should do it. . I got a bad feeling about this.

And leave this cell, with the door open. I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. And you will drop your weapon. And I'll drop my weapon. NO! Begin charging the weapon! Yes, sir.
